Routes

/: This route renders the LandPage component, presumably the main landing page of the app.

/home: This route renders the Home component, which is likely a dedicated home page with specific functionality.

/menuitems: This route renders the Index component, which is assumed to be the index page for managing menu items.

/menuitems/new: This route renders the New component, which is likely used for creating new menu items.

/menuitems/:id: This route renders the Show component, which is presumably used to display a specific menu item based on the provided ID. The colon (:) before id indicates that id is a dynamic parameter that will be passed to the Show component.

/menuitems/:id/edit: This route renders the Edit component, which is likely used for editing an existing menu item based on the provided ID. Similar to the Show route, the colon (:) before id indicates that id is a dynamic parameter.
